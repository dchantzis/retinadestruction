The objective of this dissertation is the design and implementation of a CMS called Retina-Destruction.

This system is used to generate customizable portfolio websites for visual artists.

The contents and interface design of these websites are completely customizable by the registered users.
These websites are hosted in the system and are accessible from a unique URL address.
Emphasis is given to the ways of securing web applications and their implementation to this system through carefully designed algorithms.

*This application also demonstrates ways of securing a web application according to the instructions provided by the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) community and carefully designed algorithms.*

The written part of this project analyzes the functions of the system, the structure of the database, the logic behind the organization of the code functions in files and presents some selected operations of the system.
Also included is a breakdown of the graphical interfaces of the system, and the decisions behind them.
